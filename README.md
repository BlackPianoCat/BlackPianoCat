# Hi there, I’m BlackPianoCat! 🎹🐾

I’m a **biophysicist** and **data scientist** fascinated by the mysteries of chromatin. My main focus is modeling chromatin structure and dynamics using **stochastic simulations**—all powered by Python, my language of choice.

## 🧬 What I Do

* **Modeling Chromatin:** I develop and use stochastic and molecular dynamics simulations to better understand how chromatin behaves.
* **Python Everything:** If it can be written in Python, I’ll write it in Python!
* **Big Ideas, Minimal Code:** I believe in focusing on the big picture and solving complex problems with elegant, concise code.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [RepliSage](#)

*A machine that combines stochastic simulations with molecular dynamics for the modeling of chromatin. It models the interaction between loop extrusion, epigenetic mark spreading and DNA replication. This machine is made with unique simplicity and ease of use.*

> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
> — I try to keep my codebase as lean as possible while chasing ambitious scientific questions.

* **Focus:** Understanding how DNA replicates in normal and stress conditions, with a special interest in replication dynamics during cancer.

### [MultiMM](#)

*A scalable chromatin simulation framework that spans all levels of organization—from nucleosomes to full chromosomes. Designed to be user-friendly and flexible.*

* **Goal:** Provide an accessible platform for multiscale chromatin modeling, serving both exploratory research and hypothesis testing.

### [pyLoopSage](#)

*A stochastic loop extrusion engine capable of reconstructing experimental heatmaps and modeling dynamic chromatin interactions.*

* **Utility:** Allows insight into loop extrusion mechanisms and their role in shaping the 3D genome.

## 🎯 Research Vision

My ultimate goal is to **reconstruct 3D chromatin structure directly from the DNA sequence**. This requires a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Machine Learning models** that predict chromatin interactions and epigenetic states directly from sequence.
2. **Biophysical simulations** that translate these predicted features into dynamic 3D structures.

Together, these tools aim to bridge the gap between sequence and structure—and eventually between genetics and cell behavior.
