# Hi there, I’m BlackPianoCat! 🎹🐾

I’m a **biophysicist** and **data scientist** fascinated by the mysteries of chromatin. My main focus is modeling chromatin structure and dynamics using **stochastic simulations**—all powered by Python, my language of choice.

## 🧬 What I Do

- **Modeling Chromatin:** I develop and use stochastic and molecular dynamics simulations to better understand how chromatin behaves.
- **Python Everything:** If it can be written in Python, I’ll write it in Python!
- **Big Ideas, Minimal Code:** I believe in focusing on the big picture and solving complex problems with elegant, concise code.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [RepliSage](#)
_A machine that combines stochastic simulations with molecular dynamics for the modeling of chromatin. It models the interaction between loop extrusion, epigenetic mark spreading and DNA replication. This machine is made with unique simplicity and ease of use._

> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”  
> — I try to keep my codebase as lean as possible while chasing ambitious scientific questions.

## 🎹 More About Me

- I play the piano (hence the name!)
- I enjoy biking 🚴
- I like to keep things minimalist, but I’m not afraid to be a little funny
