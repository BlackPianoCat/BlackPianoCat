# Welcome — I’m BlackPianoCat 

I am a **biophysicist** and **data scientist** specializing in the **modeling of chromatin structure and dynamics**. My research integrates **stochastic simulations**, **molecular dynamics**, and **machine learning**, all implemented in Python—my primary programming language and favorite scientific tool.

## 🧬 Research Focus

My work centers on unraveling the complexities of **chromatin architecture**, particularly how 3D genome organization arises from linear DNA sequence. To achieve this, I develop computational frameworks that combine:

* **Sequence-based predictive models** for chromatin interactions and epigenetic states.
* **Physics-driven simulations** to translate these predictions into dynamic structural models.

The ultimate goal is to construct a **hybrid pipeline** that enables **in silico reconstruction of chromatin architecture purely from sequence data**—a step toward understanding how genome structure influences function in health and disease. Until now I have implemented 3 user-friendly pipe-lines for the modeling of chromatin dynamics from experimental data.

## 🔬 Simulation Frameworks

### 🧠 RepliSage

*A minimal yet powerful simulator integrating replication dynamics, loop extrusion, and epigenetic spreading.*

* Models DNA replication under both physiological and stress conditions.
* Enables exploration of how chromatin structure and epigenetic state influence replication.
* Currently applied to study **replication stress in cancer**.

> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — My guiding principle in design and code.

### 🌐 MultiMM

*A multiscale simulation platform for modeling chromatin across all levels of organization.*

* Supports modeling from nucleosomal arrays to chromosome-scale domains.
* Designed to be user-friendly and extensible for both research and educational purposes.

---

### 🔁 pyLoopSage

*A stochastic model of loop extrusion capable of reproducing experimental Hi-C heatmaps.*

* Captures dynamic interactions mediated by loop extruding factors.
* Useful for testing hypotheses about CTCF-cohesin-mediated chromatin folding.
