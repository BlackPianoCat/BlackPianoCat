# Welcome — I’m BlackPianoCat 

I am a **biophysicist** and **data scientist** specializing in the **modeling of chromatin structure and dynamics**. My research integrates **stochastic simulations**, **molecular dynamics**, and **machine learning**, all implemented in Python—my primary programming language and favorite scientific tool.

## 👤 About Me

I’m a Greek-born scientist with a lifelong connection to the sea—having spent most of my life near the coast, the rhythm of waves and open horizons continue to inspire both my science and my music.

Outside the lab, I am passionate about music, especially classical and jazz. I’m also an active pianist and composer, always searching for harmony between creativity and structure—just like in chromatin.

Currently, I live in Warsaw, Poland, where I conduct research in the Plewczyński Lab, focusing on the biophysical modeling of chromatin and the interplay between genome organization, epigenetics, and replication dynamics.

## 🧬 Research Focus

My work centers on unraveling the complexities of **chromatin architecture**, particularly how 3D genome organization arises from linear DNA sequence. To achieve this, I develop computational frameworks that combine:

* **Sequence-based predictive models** for chromatin interactions and epigenetic states.
* **Physics-driven simulations** to translate these predictions into dynamic structural models.

The ultimate goal is to construct a **hybrid pipeline** that enables **in silico reconstruction of chromatin architecture purely from sequence data**—a step toward understanding how genome structure influences function in health and disease.

## 🔬 Simulation Frameworks

### 🧠 RepliSage

*A minimal yet powerful simulator integrating replication dynamics, loop extrusion, and epigenetic spreading.*

* Models DNA replication under both physiological and stress conditions.
* Enables exploration of how chromatin structure and epigenetic state influence replication.
* Currently applied to study **replication stress in cancer**.

> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — My guiding principle in design and code.

### 🌐 MultiMM

*A multiscale simulation platform for modeling chromatin across all levels of organization.*

* Supports modeling from nucleosomal arrays to chromosome-scale domains.
* Designed to be user-friendly and extensible for both research and educational purposes.

---

### 🔁 pyLoopSage

*A stochastic model of loop extrusion capable of reproducing experimental Hi-C heatmaps.*

* Captures dynamic interactions mediated by loop extruding factors.
* Useful for testing hypotheses about CTCF-cohesin-mediated chromatin folding.
